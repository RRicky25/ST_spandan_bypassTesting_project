Foosball Rules – No Spinning
    - There is one fundamental rule that should be applied to any foosball game: spinning is illegal. Spinning is defined by the ITSF as “the rotation of any soccer figure more than 360 degrees before or more than 360° after striking the ball.” The foosball rulebook does not say why spinning is illegal, but there are certainly a couple of very valid reasons.
    - Spinning takes away the element of skill from the game; frantic, uncontrolled spinning turns the game into a farce. The temptation for foosball beginners is to spin like crazy in the hope of smashing the ball towards the goal. For players looking to control the ball, outwit the opposition and maybe try some tricks, spinning is, to put it mildly, the curse of foosball.

Starting a Foosball Game – Service
    - In USTSA competitions, the ball is “served,” or put into play, through the service hole in the middle of the table’s side wall. These rules also state that the server can spin the ball through the hole in order to influence its entry onto the field of play.
    - A coin toss is used to decide who starts the game, with each subsequent restart being taken by the player scored against. USTSA also emphasizes the importance of asking the opposing player if he or she is ready before putting the ball into play.

Rules of Table Soccer – Scoring
    - The winner is the first player to score ten goals.
    - According to the ITSF foosball rule book, “A ball which enters the goal but returns to the playing surface and/or leaves the table still counts as a goal.” If a player strikes the ball into his own goal by accident, a point is awarded to the opposing player. If using the USTSA service rules, the ball must first be touched by a player for a goal to be awarded. A goal is not awarded if the ball somehow goes straight into a goal from the service

Rules of Table Soccer – Time Limit
    - The players have a 5 minutes time limit. At the end of play, if ten goals were not scored by either of the teams, the one with the greater number of goals wins. If the number of goals scored are equal, then sudden death (whoever scores a legal goal wins).

Foosball Dead Ball Situations
    - A dead ball occurs when the ball stops in a position where it cannot be reached by any of the players. In this situation, a player can reach into the field of play to remove the ball for a restart using the chosen service method. Reaching into the field of play is illegal at all other times. Jarring or lifting the table is against foosball rules in all circumstances.
