Contains instruction as steps which needs to be carried out before anything else for making the backend server operational.


1) 
run npm install -r requirements.txt
- If error occurs because of mysqlclient then first try running this command : sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential     and    then retry the installation of mysqlclient.
- Basically anyhow install mysql client.


2)
- In your mysql create a new database which is supposed to store the data. eg name = database_name
            CREATE DATABASE database_name;
- Create a new user with a strong password. Then grant all privileges for the above created database to  this user.
        CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
NOTE: here hostname = localhost is used. Change the localhost to handle other hosts.


3)
In the settings.py which is located in spandan app, change the database credentials with the credentials created above.
  
4)
run python3 manage.py migrate.
- This will create all the schemas in your database.


5) Dumping the users in the data base
Install pandas if not already installed.
Install openpyxl if not already installed.
- run python3 dump_users.py


6)  Add the sports_teams details in the database.
Temporarily run the server using command like python3 manage.py runserver.
Now open another termianl and run python3 teams.py
- Basically teams.py send the post request to the server to add the sports_team details.


7) Currently for sending the email in settings.py my credentials are given.
Change the credentials to like spandan.iiitb.ac.in  as required.


8)
In spandan/users/models.py  at the very end in password_reset_token_created in email_plaintext_message currently http://localhost/change/{} is used. Instead of that use the url being used. Like the previous time it was http://spandan.iiitb.ac.in/change/{}".format(reset_password_token.key)
